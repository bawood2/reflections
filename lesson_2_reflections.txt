What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized, git creates a hidden directory which it will use to store commits.  
This needs to be done in order to implement version control with git.  A repository needs to be created
before any commits can be made.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A staging area is an important part of version control because is acts as a midpoint between whats actively being worked on, and what is ready to be integrated.  The value it offers is that it allows for specific files to be committed at a time as opposed to everything which has been worked on since the last commit.  This allows for project progression that is faciliatated by the user.

change?
