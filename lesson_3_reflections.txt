When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    One advantage of having a remote reposititory is to have a back up of a working project saved somewhere which is 
    easily accessible.  Another advantage of having a remote repository is that it can be shared with others, to either
    collaborate or get feedback.  A third advantage of having a remote repository is that a project can be accessible from
    multiple computers, not just your local one.
